<h1>The Perl "Sixish" Marpa interface</h1>
<p>These notes outline my planned Marpa interface,
based on Larry Wall's Perl 6 grammars/regexes.
The Perl 6 regexes represents detailed
and advanced thinking on how to represent BNF grammars
to a modern programming audience,
and it makes sense to leverage that work.
But Marpa and LL differ heavily in their power
and abilities,
and this Marpa interface will never be
either a proper subset or superset of Perl 6.
<h2>For the first prototype</h2>
A six-ish grammar will be a series of one or more rules,
separated by a ';' character.
Rules have a lhs and a rhs.
The RHS consists of zero or more RHS elements,
A RHS element is one of:
<ul>
<li>A quoted literal, in single quotes.
Between single quotes may be any character other than an unescaped single
<li>A unquoted literal, which must be a string of letters or digits.
<li><code>ident</code>, where <code>ident</code> is the lhs
of a rule.
<li><code>&lt;~~&gt;</code>, which is idential to 
<code>lhs</code>, where <code>lhs</code> is the left hand
side symbol of the current rule.
<li>Repetition of one of the previous zero or more times,
expressed by the <code>*</code> quantifier.
</ul>
<p>Whitespace may be interspersed througout.  It is not
significant, except inside literals.
<p>
The first rule, and only the first rule,
may consist of only a RHS.
When this is the case a LHS of <code>TARGET</code>
is assumed.
A top-level rule will be the one with
<code>TARGET</code> as its LHS, explicitly or
implicitly.
There may be more than one such rule.
<h2>Limitations, but only for the moment</h2>
<ul>
<li>7-bit ASCII:
This restriction will be lifted in the first few versions.
Unicode is required for a real production quality interface.
<li>Whitespace not significant.
Perl 6 regexes do a lot around use of significant whitespace,
and leveraging that thinking and experience is a major motive
for the six-ish interface.  But not today.
</ul>
<h2>Not for a while, and maybe never</h2>
<ul>
<li>Backtracking:
Marpa does non-deterministic general BNF parsing without having to
backtrack.
Marpa could be changed to allow backtracking,
but Marpa typically can and should
solve the problem to solved in a better,
faster way.
<li>Lookahead:
Marpa does non-deterministic general BNF parsing without 
lookahead.
For special cases,
Marpa has its own similar features,
such as the Ruby Slippers.
Lookahead could be added to Marpa,
but Marpa typically can and should
deal with the problem in an easier and
faster way.
</ul>
<h2>Almost certainly never</h2>
<p>A PEG-style "pecking order"
will almost certainly never be implemented in the six-ish
interface.
Marpa does non-deterministic general BNF parsing,
and PEG-style conflict resolution is not helpful for Marpa.
