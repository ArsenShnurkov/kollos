@deftypefun const char* marpa_check_version @
    (unsigned int @var{required_major}, @
    unsigned int @var{required_minor}, @
    unsigned int @var{required_micro})

Checks that the GLib library in use is compatible with the
given version. Generally you would pass in the constants
#GLIB_MAJOR_VERSION, #GLIB_MINOR_VERSION, #GLIB_MICRO_VERSION
as the three arguments to this function; that produces
a check that the library in use is compatible with
the version of GLib the application or module was compiled
against.

Compatibility is defined by two things: first the version
of the running library is newer than the version
@var{required_major}.@var{required_minor}.@var{required_micro}.
Second
the running library must be binary compatible with the
version
@var{required_major}.@var{required_minor}.@var{required_micro}
(same major version.)

Return value: %NULL if the GLib library is compatible with the
  given version, or a string describing the version mismatch.
  The returned string is owned by GLib and must not be modified
  or freed.
