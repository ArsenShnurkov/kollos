=head2 Overview

This page is the reference for the Marpa's "BNF interface",
also called its "Stuifzand interface".
The Stuifzand interface allows strings
in place of the rule descriptors as value
of the C<rules> named
arguments of Marpa grammars.
These strings are called BNF source strings
or Stuifzand source strings.
BNF source strings are specified using the 
L<the C<source> named argument of Marpa::R2's grammars|Marpa::R2::Grammar/"source">.

=head2 The structure of the BNF source file

Whitespace separates tokens, but is otherwise ignored.
Comments are equivalent to whitespace.
A hash ("C<#>") character starts a comment,
which continues to the end of the line.

The Stuifzand format consists of production declarations.
Each production declaraton consists of a left hand side
symbol, followed by the declaration operator ("C<::=>")
and a right hand side.
Right hand sides are described below.

=head2 Symbol names

Symbol names can be either "bare" or enclosed in angle brackets.
Bare symbols names must consist entirely of Perl word characters
(alphanumerics, plus the underscore).
The angle brackets, if used, serve to "quote"
the symbol name,
and will not be part of the symbol name.

If angle brackets are used, symbol names may also contain whitespace,
as in

    <op comma>

A whitespace sequence inside angle brackets can
include any whitespace character that is legal in Perl,
including newlines.
This allows very long symbol names to be line wrapped,
if necesseary.

Unlike angle brackets, the whitespace does become part of the symbol name,
but it does so in a "normalized" form.
Leading and trailing whitespace in the name is discarded,
and all other whitespace sequences are converted to a single ASCII
space character.
This means that

    < op comma  >
    <op   comma>
    <     op comma>

and even

    <op
    comma>

will all be treated as if they were a single symbol name,
one which is in effect equivalent to C<< <op comma> >>.

=head2 Right hand sides

A right hand side may be empty, quantified, or prioritized.
A empty right hand side is what the name suggests,
no symbols, modifiers or punctuation.
A production with an empty right hand side defines an nulling rule.

=head2 Quantified right hand sides

A quantified right hand side defines a sequence rule.
It consists of a single symbol,
followed by a "quantifier",
and then followed, optionally, by modifiers.
The quantifer is either
a star ("C<*>"),
or a plus sign ("C<+>")
indicating, respectively, that the sequence rule has a minimum length
of 0 or 1.

=head2 Prioritized right hand sides

All productions which are not empty or quantified, are considered prioritized,
although the prioritization may be trivial, consisting only of a single
right hand side alternative,
at a single priority level.
Each prioritized right hand side consists of one or more right hand alternatives
("alternatives" for brevity).
An alternative is a series of one or more symbols,
followed by zero or more modifiers.

The alternatives are separated by single or double "or" symbols.
This means the alternatives in a prioritized right hand side proceed
from tightest (highest) priority to loosest.
The double "or" symbol ("C<||>") is the "loosen" operator --
the alternatives after it
have a looser (lower) priority than the alternatives before it.
The single "or" symbol ("C<|>") is the ordinary "alternative" operator --
alternatives on each side of it have the same priority.
Associativity is specified using modifiers, as described below.

Within an alternative, symbols may be enclosed in parentheses.
A symbol enclosed in parentheses is hidden from Marpa's semantics.
A set of parentheses may contain more than one symbol,
in which case the entire sequence of symbols is hidden,
as if they had been enclosed in parentheses individually.

=head2 Modifiers

Modifiers are allowed for quantified productions,
and for the right hand side alternatives in prioritized productions.
Modifiers must occur after the symbols.
Modifiers consist of a keyword, the modifier operator ("C<< => >>"),
and the modifier's value.
The keyword must be from the following list of reserved names.
Values are as described for each keyword.

=head3 action

The value of the C<action> keyword
must be a Perl word (a string of alphanumerics
or underscores).
It will be interpreted as the action name,
as described for
L<the C<action> named argument of rule descriptors|Marpa::R2::Grammar/"action">.

=head3 assoc

The C<assoc> modifier is only valid in a prioritized production.
Its value must be one of
C<left>,
C<right> or
C<group>.
Its effect will be as described below.

=head3 separator

The C<separator> keyword is only valid for a quantified right side,
and its value must be a symbol of the grammar.
It will be used as the separator,
L<as described for sequence rules|Marpa::R2::Grammar/"Sequence rules">.

=head3 proper

The C<proper> keyword is only valid for a quantified right side,
and its value must be a boolean,
in the form of a binary digit (C<0> or C<1>).
It indicates proper or Perl separartion,
L<as described for sequence rules|Marpa::R2::Grammar/"Sequence rules">.

=head2 How Marpa precedence works

Marpa's precedence is a generalization beyond the traditional ideas of precedence.
Traditional precedence parsing required the 
the classification of operators as postfix, infix, etc.
Marpa's precedence parsing is NOT based on
the special treatment of operators.
Marpa's precedence parsing,
in fact,
has no concept or definition of operator, except
as something that is not an operand.

An occurrence of the left hand side in a
right hand side alternative is called an operand.
Alternatives are assigned an arity according to
the number of operands they contain.
All arities are allowed, from zero to an arbitrary
number imposed by system limits.

An alternative with arity 0 is nullary.
Precedence and associativity
are meaningless in this
case and will be ignored.

An alternative with arity 1 is unary.
Precedence will have effect,
but left and right associativity will not.

An alternative with arity 2 is binary.
Precedence will have effect,
and left and right associativity will behave
in the traditional way,
The traditional behavior for binary alternatives
is exactly as described next for the I<N>-ary case.

An alternative with an arity of I<N>,
where I<N> is 2 or greater, is I<N>-ary.
Precedence will have effect.
For left associativity,
only the leftmost operand of an I<N>-ary alternative
associates -- operands
after the first will have the
next-tightest priority level.
For right associativity,
only the rightmost operand of an I<N>-ary alternative
associates -- all operands
except the last
will have the next-tightest priority level.

Marpa also allows "group" associativity.
In "group" associativity, all operands associate
at the loosest (lowest) priority.
That is, in an alternative with group associativity,
each operand may be a full expression of the kind
defined by the prioritized production.
"Group" associativity is used, for example,
in implementing the traditional function of parentheses
in Marpa.
Group associativity is meaningless for nullary alternatives,
and is ignored.

=head2 Caveats

=head3 Symbol names

The BNF interface may rewrite its symbol names internally.
Here we call the name by which a symbol is specified in the
BNF interface string its "external symbol name",
and its name as rewritten, its "internal symbol name".
Marpa::R2 usually makes sure the user sees only
external symbol names.
For example,
L<the C<rule()> Grammar method|Marpa::R2::Grammar/"rule()">
returns external symbol names.

However,
for some purposes, such as tracing grammars, the use of
internal names may sometimes
be appropriate.
Marpa::R2's use of external versus internal symbol name
is evolving.
When the Stuifzand interface is used,
the exact form of Marpa's internal names should be
treated as beta,
and subject to change.

=head3 Precedence: the good news

Marpa's generalization of precedence works
for all grammars that
can be defined by prioritized productions.
It is efficient (linear) for all grammars that could be
parsed by the traditional precedence parsing methods.
Marpa also allows you to defined alternatives
not allowed by traditional methods.
Many of these are useful,
and most of those can also be parsed efficiently.

=head3 Precedence and ambiguous grammars

Because of the many forms of recursion allowed,
it is possible
to define highly ambiguous grammars using the precedence mechanism.
This can occur even by accident.

The user should especially be careful with
right hand side alternatives in
which all the symbols are operands.
These can be useful.
For example, an implicit operation can be defined using
an binary alternative with no non-operands,
and this could implement, for example,
the standard notation for concatenation or multiplication.
But to do this efficiently
requires either avoiding ambiguity,
or controlling its use carefully.

Marpa does catch the case where an alternative consists
only of a single operand -- a "unit rule".
This causes a fatal error.
Unit rules are easy to define by accident in
the Stuifzand interface.
The author knows of no practical use for them,
and their presence in a grammar is usually
unintentional.
Note that, in the event an application
does find a use for such rules,
Marpa can parse grammar which includes unit rules,
via its other interfaces.
