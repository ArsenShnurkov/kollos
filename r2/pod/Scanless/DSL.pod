=head1 About this document

This page is the reference for domain-specific language at
the center
of Marpa's Scanless interface (SLIF).

The format of
Scanless source strings is
L<that of
BNF source strings|Marpa::R2::BNF>,
with the following changes
and extensions:

=head1 Structural rule

The BNF operator ("C<::=>")
has the same function as before,
but in addition it indicates that the rule is
a G1 rule.
Start rules must be G1 rules.

=head1 Lexical rule

The match operator ("C<~>")
can be used between the LHS and RHS of a rule,
instead of the BNF operator.
Rules which use the match operator are G0 rules.
Discard rules must be G0 rules.
A lexical rule cannot have an C<action> adverb.

=head1 Default pseudo-rule

=head1 Lexeme default statement

The lexeme default statement is a "statement",
instead of a "rule".
Rules
are signified by the BNF operator ("C<::=>")
or the match operator ("C<~>"),
and their effect depends on their
lexical position.
Statements
are signified by the assignment operator ("C<=>"),
and their effect is global.
The effect of a statement does not
depend on where in the source file it occurs.

At this writing the lexeme default statement is only way to
specify the semantics of lexemes.
Only one lexeme default statement is allowed in a file.

=head1 C<action> adverb

=head1 Word actions

If the action value is a
a Perl word (a string of alphanumerics or underscores),
it will be interpreted as the action name,
as described for
L<the C<action> named argument of rule descriptors|Marpa::R2::Grammar/"action">.
A rule with a word action is allowed to have a bless adverb,
but as of this writing the blessing will have no effect.
Word actions are not allowed for for lexemes.

=head1 Reserved actions

If the action value begins with a double colon ("C<::>"),
it is a reserved word action.
For rules, the following are recognized:

=over 4

=item * C<::array>

The value of the semantics is an array.
For a rule, the array will
containg the
values of each of its children.
If the rule has no children, the array will be empty.
For a lexeme, the array will be of length one,
and contain the token value.

=item * C<::dwim>

This is the "do what I mean action".
The intent is to create an AST
structure that avoids trivial and useless nodes,
but that is also convenient to traverse and evaluate.

If the action of a lexeme is C<::dwim>, the value of the lexeme
will be its token value if the lexeme is not blessed.
If the lexeme is blessed, its value will be an array of length
one, the only element of which is the token value.

For a rule, the C<::dwim> action
is equivalent to one of the other reserved word actions,
as determined by applying the following criteria, in sequence:

=over 4

=item *

If the action is for a
rule that is blessed, C<::dwim> is equivalent to C<::array>.

=item *

If the action is for a sequence rule, C<::dwim> is equivalent to C<::array>.

=item *

If the action is for a rule with two or more children,
C<::dwim> is equivalent to C<::array>.

=item *

If the action is for a rule with one child,
C<::dwim> is equivalent to C<::first>.

=item *

If the action is for a rule with no children,
C<::dwim> is equivalent to C<::undef>.

=back 

=item * C<::first>

The value of the semantics is that of the rule's first child.
If there is no such child, the value is a Perl C<undef>.

It is a fatal error if a bless action
is applied to a rule with a C<::first> action.
This is the case even when either or both adverbs are
the result of a default.
It is also a fatal error to use C<::first> action
with a lexeme.

=item * C<::undef>

The value of the semantics is 
a Perl C<undef>.
It is a fatal error if a bless action
is applied to a rule with a C<::undef> action.
This is the case even when either or both adverbs are
the result of a default.

=back

=head2 Array descriptor actions

    [range,values]

If the value of an action adverb begins with a left square bracket,
it is an array descriptor.
An array descriptor is a comma separated list of zero or more array
descriptor items.
The value of the lexeme or rule will be an array, with contents
as determined by the array descriptor items.
The lists will be placed in the array in the order
specified.
If no array descriptor items are specified, the value
of the lexeme or rule will be an empty array.

Currently there are only two array descriptor items.
The C<range> array descriptor item will put a list two elements
into the array indicates the location in the input stream
of the rule or lexeme.
The first element will be the start position,
and the second will be the end position.

For a rule,
the C<values> array descriptor item indicates a list containing
the values of
the rule's children, in left-to-right order.
For a lexeme, 
the C<value> array descriptor item will be a single element --
the token value of the lexeme.

C<::array> is equivalent to C<[values]>.
The C<value> and C<values> array descriptor items are synonyms,
and may be used interchangeably for both rules and lexemes.
This means that, for both lexemes and rules,
the actions C<[values]>, C<[value]> and C<::array>
will do exactly the same thing.

=head1 C<bless> adverb

The C<bless> adverb causes the result of the semantics to be
blessed into the class indicated by the value of the adverb.
If the adverb value is a Perl word
(a string of alphanumerics or underscores),
the name of the class will be formed by prepending
the value of L<the C<bless_package>
named argument|Marpa::R2::Scanless::G/"bless_package">.

If the value begins with a double colon ("C<::>"), it is a
reserved value.
A bless value of C<::undef> means no blessing, and this is the
default for both rules and lexemes.
If any rule or lexeme of a SLIF grammar has
a bless value other than C<::undef>,
a C<bless_package> is required,
and failure to specify one results in
a fatal error.

The bless adverb for
rules allows one additional reserved value: C<::lhs>.
A reserved value of C<::lhs> causes the result to be blessed into
a class named based on the LHS of the rule.
The class will be the name of the LHS with whitespace (as already
normalized for the symbol name) changed to an underscore.
When a C<::lhs> bless value applies to a rule, it is a fatal
error if the LHS contains anything other than an alphanumeric
or whitespace.
In particular, the LHS cannot already contain an underscore ("C<_>").
The C<::lhs> blessing is most useful in a default rule.

The bless adverb for lexemes allows only one
reserved value: C<::name>.
A reserved value of C<::name> causes the result to be blessed into
a class named based on the name of the rule.
The class is derived from the symbol name in the same way,
and subject to the same restrictions,
as described above for deriving a class name from the LHS
of a rule.
The C<::name> reserved blessing is most useful in
the lexeme default rule.

=head1 Discard rules

A discard rule is a rule whose LHS is
the C<:discard> pseudo-symbol,
and whose RHS is a single symbol name,
called the B<discarded symbol>.
These rules indicate that the discarded symbol is a top-level G0
symbol, but one which is not a lexeme.
When a discarded symbol is recognized,
it is not passed as a lexeme to the G1 parser, but is
(as the name suggests) discarded.

=head1 Single quoted strings

Single quotes can be used in prioritized
rules to indicate character strings.
The characters inside the single quote
will be matched in the input, literally and one-for-one.
Single quoted strings can contain any characters with
the exception of
single quotes and vertical whitespace.

Single quoted strings do not allow "escaped" characters.
A backslash ("C<\>") represents itself and has no effect
on the interpretation of the next character.
If a rule needs to match one of the forbidden characters
(single quote or vertical whitespace), it must use a
character class.

Single quoted strings are always interpreted at the
G0 level, but they may be used in either structural
or lexical rules.
When a single quoted string is used in a structural rule,
Marpa creates a virtual G0 rule on behalf of the application.
This is handy, but it does have a real disadvantage --
the name of the virtual rule's LHS
will be one assigned automatically by Marpa.
When tracing and debugging parses and grammars,
these virtual LHS's can be harder for a programmer
to interpret.

=head1 Character classes

A character class in square brackets ("C<[]>")
can be used in a RHS alternative of a prioritized rule,
or on the RHS of a quantified rule or a discard rule.
Marpa character classes may contain anything acceptable to Perl,
and follow the same escaping conventions as Perl's character classes.

Character classes are always interpreted at the
G0 level, but they may be used in either structural
or lexical rules.
When a character class is used in a structural rule,
Marpa creates a virtual G0 rule on behalf of the application.
This is handy, but it does have a real disadvantage --
the name of the virtual rule's LHS
will be one assigned automatically by Marpa.
When tracing and debugging parses and grammars,
these virtual LHS's can be harder for a programmer
to interpret.

An implementation note: character classes are
interpreted by Perl, but this involves minimal overhead
when the parse is of any length.
Each character class is
passed to Perl to interpret exactly once and the result is
memoized in a C structure for future use.
