=head1 About this document

This page is the reference for domain-specific language at
the center
of Marpa's Scanless interface (SLIF).

The format of
Scanless source strings is
L<that of
BNF source strings|Marpa::R2::BNF>,
with the following changes
and extensions:

=head1 Structural rule

The BNF operator ("C<::=>")
has the same function as before,
but in addition it indicates that the rule is
a G1 rule.
Start rules must be G1 rules.

=head1 Lexical rule

The match operator ("C<~>")
can be used between the LHS and RHS of a rule,
instead of the BNF operator.
Rules which use the match operator are G0 rules.
Discard rules must be G0 rules.
A lexical rule cannot have an C<action> adverb.

=head1 Default pseudo-rule

=head1 Lexeme default statement

The lexeme default statement is a "statement",
instead of a "rule".
Rules
are signified by the BNF operator ("C<::=>")
or the match operator ("C<~>"),
and their effect depends on their
lexical position.
Statements
are signified by the assignment operator ("C<=>"),
and their effect is global.
The effect of a statement does not
depend on where in the source file it occurs.

Only one lexeme default statement is allowed in a file.

=head1 Discard rules

A discard rule is a rule whose LHS is
the C<:discard> pseudo-symbol,
and whose RHS is a single symbol name,
called the B<discarded symbol>.
These rules indicate that the discarded symbol is a top-level G0
symbol, but one which is not a lexeme.
When a discarded symbol is recognized,
it is not passed as a lexeme to the G1 parser, but is
(as the name suggests) discarded.

=head1 Single quoted strings

Single quotes can be used in prioritized
rules to indicate character strings.
The characters inside the single quote
will be matched in the input, literally and one-for-one.
Single quoted strings can contain any characters with
the exception of
single quotes and vertical whitespace.

Single quoted strings do not allow "escaped" characters.
A backslash ("C<\>") represents itself and has no effect
on the interpretation of the next character.
If a rule needs to match one of the forbidden characters
(single quote or vertical whitespace), it must use a
character class.

Single quoted strings are always interpreted at the
G0 level, but they may be used in either structural
or lexical rules.
When a single quoted string is used in a structural rule,
Marpa creates a virtual G0 rule on behalf of the application.
This is handy, but it does have a real disadvantage --
the name of the virtual rule's LHS
will be one assigned automatically by Marpa.
When tracing and debugging parses and grammars,
these virtual LHS's can be harder for a programmer
to interpret.

=head1 Character classes

A character class in square brackets ("C<[]>")
can be used in a RHS alternative of a prioritized rule,
or on the RHS of a quantified rule or a discard rule.
Marpa character classes may contain anything acceptable to Perl,
and follow the same escaping conventions as Perl's character classes.

Character classes are always interpreted at the
G0 level, but they may be used in either structural
or lexical rules.
When a character class is used in a structural rule,
Marpa creates a virtual G0 rule on behalf of the application.
This is handy, but it does have a real disadvantage --
the name of the virtual rule's LHS
will be one assigned automatically by Marpa.
When tracing and debugging parses and grammars,
these virtual LHS's can be harder for a programmer
to interpret.

An implementation note: character classes are
interpreted by Perl, but this involves minimal overhead
when the parse is of any length.
Each character class is
passed to Perl to interpret exactly once and the result is
memoized in a C structure for future use.
