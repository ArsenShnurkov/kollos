@** About this library.
This is Marpa's ``ami'' or ``friend'' library, for macros
and functions which are useful for Libmarpa and its
``close friends''.
The contents of this library are considered ``undocumented'',
in the sense that
they are not documented for general use.
Specifically, the interfaces of these functions is subject
to radical change without notice,
and it is assumed that the safety of such changes can
be ensured by checking only Marpa itself and its ``close friend''
libraries.

A ``close friend'' library is one which is allowed
to rely on undocumented Libmarpa interfaces.
At this writing,
the only example of a ``close friend'' library is the Perl XS code which
interfaces libmarpa to Perl.

The ami interface and an internal interface differ in that
\li The ami interface must be useable in a situation where the Libmarpa
implementor does not have complete control over the namespace.
It can only create names which begin in |marpa_|, |_marpa_| or
one of its capitalization variants.
The internal interface can assume that no library will be included
unless the Libmarpa implementor decided it should be, so that most
names are available for his use.
\li The ami interface cannot use Libmarpa's error handling -- although
it can be part of the implementation of that error handlind.
The ami interface must be useable in a situation where another
error handling regime is in effect.

@** About this document.
This document is very much under construction,
enough so that readers may question why I make it
available at all.  Two reasons:
\li Despite its problems, it is the best way to read the source code
at this point.
\li Since it is essential to changing the code, not making it available
could be seen to violate the spirit of the open source.

@*0 Inlining.
Most of this code in |libmarpa|
will be frequently executed.
Inlining is used a lot.
Enough so
that it is useful to define a macro to let me know when inlining is not
used in a private function.

@*0 Marpa global Setup.

Marpa has no globals as of this writing.
For thread-safety, among other reasons,
I'll try to keep it that way.

@** Lightweight boolean vectors (LBV).
These macros and functions assume that the 
caller remembers the boolean vector's length.
They also take no precautions about trailing bits
in the last word.
Most operations do not need to.
When and if there are such operations,
it will be up to the caller to make sure that
the trailing bits are correct.

@** Boolean vectors.
Marpa's boolean vectors are adapted from
Steffen Beyer's Bit-Vector package on CPAN.
This is a combined Perl package and C library for handling
boolean vectors.
Someone seeking a general boolean vector package should
look at Steffen's instead.
|libmarpa|'s boolean vectors are tightly tied in
with its own needs and environment.

@** Boolean matrixes.
Marpa's boolean matrixes are implemented differently
from the matrixes in
Steffen Beyer's Bit-Vector package on CPAN,
but like Beyer's matrixes are build on that package.
Beyer's matrixes are a single boolean vector
which special routines index by row and column.
Marpa's matrixes are arrays of vectors.

Since there are ``hidden words" before the data
in each vectors, Marpa must repeat these for each
row of a vector.  Consequences:
\li Marpa matrixes use a few extra bytes per row of space.
\li Marpa's matrix pointers cannot be used as vectors.
\li Marpa's rows {\bf can} be used as vectors.
\li Marpa's matrix pointers point to the beginning of
the allocated space.  |Bit_Vector| pointers use trickery
and include ``hidden words" before the pointer.
@ Note that |typedef|'s for |Bit_Matrix|
and |Bit_Vector| are identical.

identical ``hidden word" data for each row of a matrix

@** Efficient stacks and queues.
@ The interface for these macros is somewhat hackish,
in that the user often
must be aware of the implementation of the
macros.
Arguably, using these macros is not
all that easier than
hand-writing each instance.
But the most important goal was safety -- by
writing this stuff once I have a greater assurance
that it is tested and bug-free.
Another important goal was that there be
no compromise on efficiency,
when compared to hand-written code.

@*0 Fixed size stacks.
|libmarpa| uses stacks and worklists extensively.
Often a reasonable maximum size is known when they are
set up, in which case they can be made very fast.

@*0 Dynamic stacks.
|libmarpa| uses stacks and worklists extensively.
This stack interface resizes itself dynamically.
There are two disadvantages.

\li There is more overhead ---
overflow must be checked for with each push,
and the resizings, while fast, do take time.

\li The stack may be moved after any |DSTACK_PUSH|
operation, making all pointers into it invalid.
Data must be retrieved from the stack before the
next |DSTACK_PUSH|.
In the special 2-argument form,
|DSTACK_INIT2|, the stack is initialized
to a size convenient for the memory allocator.
{\bf To Do}: @^To Do@>

@ |DSTACK_SAFE| is for cases where the dstack is not
immediately initialized to a useful value,
and might never be.
All fields are zeroed so that when the containing object
is destroyed, the deallocation logic knows that no
memory has been allocated and therefore no attempt
to free memory should be made.

@ A stack reinitialized by
|DSTACK_CLEAR| contains 0 elements,
but has the same capacity as it had before the reinitialization.
This saves the cost of reallocating the dstack's buffer,
and leaves its capacity at what is hopefully
a stable, high-water mark, which will make future
resizings unnecessary.

This is simply a dynamic stack extended with a second
index.
These is no destructor at this point, because so far all uses
of this let another container ``steal" the data from this one.

Instead I define a destructor for the ``thief" container to use
when it needs to free the data.

@** Counted integer lists (CIL).
As a structure,
almost not worth bothering with,
if it were not for its use in CILAR's.
The first |int| is a count, and purists might insist
on a struct instead of an array.
A struct would reflect the logical structure more
accurately.
But would it make the actual code 
less readable, not more,
which I believe has to be the object.

@** Counted integer list arena (CILAR).
These implement an especially efficient memory allocation scheme.
Libmarpa needs many copies of integer lists,
where the integers are symbol ID's, rule ID's, etc.
The same ones are used again and again.
The CILAR allows them to be allocated once and reused.
\par
The CILAR is a software implementation
of memory which is both random-access
and content-addressable.
Content-addressability saves space -- when the
contents are identical they can be reused.
The content-addressability is implemented in software
(as an AVL).
While lookup is not slow
the intention is that the content-addressability will used
infrequently --
once created or found the CIL will be memoized
for random-access through a pointer.

@*0 Obstacks.
|libmarpa| uses the system malloc,
either directly or indirectly.
Indirect use comes via obstacks.
Obstacks are more efficient, but 
limit the ability to resize memory,
and to control the lifetime of the memory.
@ Obstacks are widely used inside |libmarpa|.
Much of the memory allocated in |libmarpa| is
\li In individual allocations less than 4K, often considerable less.
\li Once created, are kept for the entire life of the either the grammar or the recognizer.
\li Once created, is never resized.
For these, obstacks are perfect.
|libmarpa|'s grammar has an obstacks.
Small allocations needed for the lifetime of the grammar
are allocated on these as the grammar object is built.
All these allocations are are conveniently and quickly deallocated when
the grammar's obstack is destroyed along with its parent grammar.

@*0 Memory allocation.
libmarpa wrappers the standard memory functions
to provide more convenient behaviors.
\li The allocators do not return on failed memory allocations.

@** File layout.  
@ The output files are {\bf not} source files,
but I add the license to them anyway,
as close to the top as possible.
@ Also, it is helpful to someone first
trying to orient herself,
if built source files contain a comment
to that effect and a warning
not that they are
not intended to be edited directly.
So I add such a comment.

@ This is the license language for the header files.
