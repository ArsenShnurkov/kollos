* Update SLIF semantics documents

Later:

* Add pseudo-symbols: :null, :empty -- sugar for empty RHS alternative

* Add pseudo-symbols: :external, :never -- sugar for [^\d\D]

* Problem with indirect nulling.  Modifying Semantics::Null to add explicit
  empty production changes semantics.  "Topmost nulled" rule seems not to be
  followed in this case.  This is a "later to do" because the same issue exists
  in the NAIF.
