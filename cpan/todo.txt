* Fix NAIF doc for constant actions

* Document
  * fully qualified actions now allowed in SLIF
  * null_ranking adverb added
  * semantics_package named argument
  * $slr->value() arg
  * Discourage action_object named argument
  * $slg->set() for trace_file_handle named argument
  * $slr->set() for end, trace_file_handle, semantics_package named arguments
  * $slr->series_restart().

Later:

* Add pseudo-symbols: :null, :empty -- sugar for empty RHS alternative

* Add pseudo-symbols: :external, :never -- sugar for [^\d\D]

* Problem with indirect nulling.  Modifying Semantics::Null to add explicit
  empty production changes semantics.  "Topmost nulled" rule seems not to be
  followed in this case.  This is a "later to do" because the same issue exists
  in the NAIF.
