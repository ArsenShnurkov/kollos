Those who view mathematical science,
not merely as a vast body of abstract and immutable truths,
whose intrinsic beauty,
symmetry and logical completeness,
when regarded in their connexion together as a whole,
entitle them to a prominent place in the interest of all profound
and logical minds,
but as possessing a yet deeper interest for the human race,
when it is remembered that this science constitutes the language
through which alone we can adequately express the great facts of
the natural world,
and those unceasing changes of mutual relationship which,
visibly or invisibly,
consciously or unconsciously to our immediate physical perceptions,
are interminably going on in the agencies of the creation we live amidst:
those who thus think on mathematical truth as the instrument through
which the weak mind of man can most effectually read his Creator's
works,
will regard with especial interest all that can tend to facilitate
the translation of its principles into explicit practical forms.
