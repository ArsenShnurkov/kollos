This directory contains a standard Lua 5.1 interpreter "as is" and
un-customized.  For an arbitrary build target it is just as easy to
build it as to find an interpreter with exactly the right version.

You might ask, "Why not apply the same logic to the interpreter?"
But the libraries have standard cmake modules for finding them, which
for the moment I will trust.  Also, for linking into the Kollos shared
library, we may want to allows appropriate substitutions -- such as the
5.1-based luajit for plain lua 5.1.
