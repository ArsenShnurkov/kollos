# Kollos: sequence rule rewrite

This document describes how the LUIF rewrites
sequence rules.

[ Lots and lots to be added here. ]

There is
[a Perl script in a Github
gist](https://gist.github.com/jeffreykegler/2324781#file-minmax_to_bnf-pl)
implementing
a rewrite of rules of the form `A ::= B{min,max}`
