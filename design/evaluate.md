# Kollos: evaluation

This document describes how evaluation will be done
in the LUIF.
It assumes you've read the document on grammar
rewrites.

Libmarpa does much of the evaluation work for the
LUIF, but there is the issue of undoing the grammar
rewrites.
This is necessary, because the semantics are defined
in terms of Kollos rules and symbols,
while Libmarpa deals with Libmarpa rules
and symbols.

## Performing the evalution

First, the Libmarpa parse should be turned into a tree,
with each node containing the Libmarpa rule, following by its
RHS children.

Then the tree should be evaluated left-to-right
bottom-to-top.
At each rule node,
as a first step,
all children which are mortar or hidden symbols
are discarded.

## Intermediate rules

What happens next depends on whether the rule is
semantically active or not.
If the rule is *not* semantically active, then
the non-discarded RHS symbol are
put into a "intermediate result" Lua object,
which is passed as the value.

## Semantically active rules

If the rule *is* semantically active, its children
are first "flattened".
That is, each rule has been packing its children into
an object, which contains the children of other rules
as objects, and so on recursively.
This must now be undone.

In the semantically active rule, we create an "descendants"
stack for the semantics,
proceeding from left to right.
If the child is a terminal, we push it onto the descendants stack.
Otherwise we call the flatten method for a "intermediate result" object,
passing the stack to it.

The flatten method for
each intermediate result object does essentially that same thing,
recursively.
More specifically,
the intermediate result object is an array.
The flatten method proceeds in lexical order through the array.
For each terminal, it pushes it onto the child stack.
(Recall that the "descendants stack" was passed to the flatten
method as an argument.)
Otherwise, the array element must be a "intermediate result" object,
in which case that object's "flatten" method is called,
with the "descendant's stack" as it argument.

For sequence rules, this recursions can be very long.
The net result will be that the descendants stack contains
the non-hidden brick symbols, in lexical order.
These can now be passed as arguments to the semantics.

Since this is a semantically active rule,
its LHS is a brick symbol,
and it maps to the LHS of a Kollos rule.
We look up the semantics for this Kollos rule,
and apply them to its arguments, which are now the
elements of the descendants stack.

The result of the semantically active rule will be a single
value, which we wrap into a singleton "intermediate result" object.
This object becomes the value of the rule.

### Start rule

The grammar has an augmented start rule of the
form
```
    <augmented start> ::= <old start symbol>
```

The augmented start is evaluation differently from
other rules.
First off, if the parse is nulled (zero length),
the whole evaluation is treated as a special case.
In that case, `<old start symbol>` will have a nulling
semantics.
This nulling semantics is used to determine a value,
and that value becomes the value of the parse.

If the parse is successful,
and is not nulled,
then the only child of the augmented start rule
will be a brick-result object,
and that brick-result object
will be a singleton -- its array
will contain only one element.
That element becomes the value of the parse.

## Futures

The method described above is not the best.
The current SLIF uses a dual-stack mechanism -- one stack
for the arguments to the semantics, and a second one
of rules.
The rules stack contains indexes to the arguments stack.
This is more efficient than the above,
but harder to implement.

One reason not to bother with the dual-stack implementation,
is that there is probably an even better way --
rewriting the ASF logic.
The ASF (abstract syntax forest) logic is
now in the SLIF, and is in Perl,
so it's currently not every efficient.

If the ASF logic were used,
evaluation would take place
by traversing the ASF
top-down.
To iterate the ASF,
the choices at each glade can be tracked using
a stack.

This would have the advantage, that sections of the ASF
whose topmost symbol is "hidden", can be skipped.
In many cases, this can be a major efficiency.
This also open the road to
symbol hiding, and
partial evaluation, as a technique in itself.
