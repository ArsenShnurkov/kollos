>> Kollos (speaking through Spock)

The name of this project is that of a Star Trek character,
Kollos.   He's the Medusan ambassador
in Episode 5 of Season 3.
Since Medusans are
disembodied balls of energy, he has no voice, and
speaks through the other characters.
The quote above is spoken by Kollos while in Spock's body.
