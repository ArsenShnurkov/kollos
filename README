This is a working repository for RELEASE 2 of the Marpa.  This is
beta software.

This repository contains the Marpa::R2 module.  It has a CPAN-based
installation procedure.

Within Marpa::R2 are several development directories.  These are
not needed to build & install Marpa::R2, or even to do much of the
development.  These do not have stable, fully documented installation
procedures.
