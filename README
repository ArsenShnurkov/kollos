This is a working repository for the various Marpa projects.

The projects are joined into a single repository because at this
point they are being refactored.
Because this repository is a
collection of development environments for the author's own use,
how to install it continually changes.  There are installation notes
in the file INSTALL.

There is not fixed installation procedure.  If this combined repository
last long enough, and stabilizes, maybe there will be one someday.

In the meantime, for the author's own use, there are installation
notes.  There contain an installation checklist.  For the author's
own convenience, he tries to keep these accurate and up-to-date.
He does not succeed 100%.
