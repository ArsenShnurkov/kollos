This is a working repository for the various Marpa projects.  The
projects are joined into a single repository because at this point
they are being refactored.

Because this repository is an ad hoc collection of separate development
environments, there is no real installation procedure.

There are installation notes in the file INSTALL_NOTES.  The author
created these as an aid to his memory.  For his own sake, he makes
a certain amount of effort to keep these installation notes accurate
and up-to-date.  At points they have amounted to a fairly good
installation procedure.  At other times ... well, they're better
than nothing.

If this combined repository lasts long enough, and stabilizes, maybe
someday there will be a real installation procedure.
