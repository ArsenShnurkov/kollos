Kollos in its libmarpa/ directory has a copy of the "kollos" branch of
the libmarpa repo, with full history.  To update it, you have to fetch the
upstream, then "git mv" the files into the libmarpa directory, then merge.
(I have yet to actually try this.)

The "git mv" is tricky -- you have to avoid untracked files, and the
libmarpa repo itself.  As I recall, I used these commands.

  git mv [a-k]* libmarpa
  git mv legal libmarpa
  git mv [m-z]* libmarpa
  git mv L* libmarpa
  git mv $( git ls-files .g* ) libmarpa

I will probably need to check that this catches everything.  Useful is
the "-n" option of "git mv", which does a "dry run" -- showing the moves,
without actually performing them.
