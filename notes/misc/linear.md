# When in Marpa linear?

This contains some theoretical notes
on the grammars for which Marpa is linear.
These notes are very rough and preliminary,
and not intended to be understand by anyone
but Jeffrey.

## Right recursions

A right recursion is a non-trivial sequence of derivations,
in which the the rightmost symbol of the first step
of the sequence is also the rightmost symbol of the
last step.

A right recursion derivation
step is a single step in a right recursion
which replaces the rightmost symbol,
call it `A`,
with `rhs`
where `A ::= rhs` must be a rule in `g`.
`A ::= rhs` is said to have been "used"
in the right recursive derivation step.
If a rule is used in a right recursive
derivation step,
it is called a right recursive rule.

A right recursion is *marked* if and only if
the only Earley set in an Earley parse where
it adds completions is the set built when
scanning its last symbol.

A right recursion is *Leo-memoable*
at a location,
or *memoable*,
if one of its recursion symbols
ends at that location,
and produces a completion in the Earley set
at that location.
A right recursion is *fully memoable* if and only if
it is memoable at the location of all of its recursion
symbols.

A right recursion is *Leo-memoized*, or *memoized*,
at a location,
is if is Leo-memoable,
and the right recursion symbol is unique,
in the sense that it occurs as the postdot
symbol of exactly one Earley item.

A "skip" in a Leo-memoization is a location
which is Leo-memoable, but which is not
Leo-memoized.
A "skip sequence" is a set of consecutive
right recursion parse locations
which are all skips.

Theorem:
A right recursion is either marked or fully
memoable.

Proof:

Assume for a reductio that,
in an unmarked right recursion,
there is a right recursion location,
call it `L`,
and that `L` is not memoable.
If
`L` is a right recursive location,
then there is a right recursive symbol,
call it `RR`,
ending at `L`.
The right recursion must occur in the Earley
parse,
and therefore so must all of its right recursive
symbols.
So there must be a completion for `RR` at `L`.
Therefore `L` is memoable, contrary to assumption
for the reductio.
Hence all locations `L` are memoable,
and the right recursion is fully memoable.
QED.

[ Note: the fact that the right recursion is unmarked
is really not used in the above proof.
This should be cleaned up. ]

At a skip, the right recursive completions
are added as far back as the beginning of
the right recursion,
or as the most recent Leo memoization
whichever is encountered first.

[ Demonstrate in more detail that
the creation of completions stops
when the first Leo item is encountered? ].

The number of completions add for a unmarked
right recursion is as follows:

* For the first right recursive symbol, 1 completion.

* For the right recursive symbol symbols after the first,

   - If the preceding location was not a skip, 2 completions.

   - If the preceding `n` locations, where `n` is greater than 0,
     were skips, `n + 1` completions.

## Amortization of marked right recursions

[ How to do this? ]

## Unambiguous Right Recursions

In an unambiguous grammar,
every right recursive symbol produces,
for a specific sentence,
a unique set
of transition symbols, factored uniquely.

Proof:
The proof is by reduction to absurdity.
Call the sentence `x`.
Suppose a right recursion,
from one of its right-recursive
symbols, `RR`
produced more than
one set of transition symbols,
or that
the set it produced could be factored differently.
There would be two derivation trees from `RR`
of `x`,
so that `RR` would be an ambiguous symbol.
Since `RR` is an ambiguous symbol.
and any grammar containing `RR` would be
ambiguous,
which is contrary to assumption for the theorem.
QED.

## Double Ended Recursions

Definition: A derivation is a double ended
recursion
if it is both a left and a right recursion.
That is, if it is
```
    A =>* A middle A
```
where `middle` if a sentential
form which may be empty or contain
other instances of `A`.

Theorem:
If a grammar is unambiguous,
it does not allow a double-ended recursion.

Proof:
Assume for a reductio that
grammar `g` is unambiguous, but that for some input
it contains, `Deriv`,
the derivation
```
   A ->+ A middle A,
```

We can derive the sentential form
```
   A middle A middle A
```
by expanding either the rightmost or
leftmost A in `Deriv`.
In the first case the tree has the form
```
A(A middle (A middle A))
```
and in the second
case it is
```
A((A middle A) middle A)
```
These are two different derivation trees,
so that A is an ambiguous symbol.
Since grammar `g` contains `A`,
an ambiguous symbol,
`g` is ambiguous.
But `g` was assumed to be unambiguous
for the reductio.
This show the reductio.
QED.

## No Ambi-recursive symbols in unambiguous grammars.

Definition: A symbol is ambi-recursive
if it allows the two derivations
```
    A =>+ A after
    A =>+ before A
```
where `before` and `after`
are sentential
forms which must be non-empty,
but which may contain
other instances of `A`.

Theorem:
If a grammar is unambiguous,
it has no ambi-recursive symbols.

Proof:
Assume for a reductio that
grammar `g` is unambiguous, but that for some
symbol `A`
we have the two derivatsions,
```
   A ->+ A after, and
   A ->+ before A, and
```
where `after` and `before` are non-empty.

We can derive the sentential form
```
   before A after
```
in two ways, as
```
   D1: A ->+ A after ->+ before A after, and as
   D2: A ->+ before A ->+ before A after
```

We have three cases:

* "After first": The derivation step `A after` comes first.

* "Before first": The derivation step `before A` comes first.

* "Before equals after": `before A == A after`.

We first show that the "Before equals after" case is
impossible, using a reductio.
For the reductio,
we assume that `D1 == D2`.
If `before A == A after`, since both `before` and
`after` are non-empty, we must have that
```
   Eq-1: before A == A after == A middle A
```
where middle is a sentential form which may
contain another instance of `A`,
and which may be empty.
But if `Eq-1` is true,
then
```
   A ->+ A middle A,
```
which is a double-ended recursion,
so that A must be an ambiguous symbol.
If `A` is ambiguous, then `g` is ambiguous
contrary to assumption for the outer
reductio.
This show the inner reductio,
and that the "Before equals after" case
is false.

For the remaining two cases,
the derivation trees have the forms
```
    A(before A(A after)), and
    A(A(before A) after)
```
Since `before A != A after`,
these are two different derivation trees,
so that A is an ambiguous symbol.
Since grammar `g` contains `A`,
an ambiguous symbol,
`g` is ambiguous.
But `g` was assumed to be unambiguous
for the outer reductio.
This shows the outer reductio
and the theorem.
QED.

## Eruption plans

A sequence of duples `[element, ord]`,
where `element` is a rule or a token,
and `ord` is 
an ordinal whose use will
be described.
`undef` is allowed as a value of `ord`,
in which case `ord` is said to be undefined.

All plans have at least two steps.
The first plan step is always `[start, undef]`.
where `start` is the start rule of `g`.
The last plan step is always `[token, ord]`,
where `token` is a terminal symbol,
and `ord` is an integer.
Steps other than the first and last are always
of the form `[rule, ord]`
where `rule` is a rule of `g`,
and `ord` in an integer.

## Two eruptions, one right signature

Theorem:
If two distinct eruptions are distinct,
then they are part of distinct derivation
trees.

Proof:
We first show that two eruptions
are distinct,
the derivation trees in which they occur
must be distinct.
Assume for a reductio that two
eruptions share the same derivation
tree.
They must also share the same chamber.
We follow the eruption
from its chamber.
If the eruptions are distinct,
or some node of the eruption will have
two up-paths.
But, an eruption is a derivation path,
so that this is not possible.
The shows the reductio,
and the theorem.
QED.

Theorem:
If two distinct eruptions over a sentence,
call it `seen`,
have one right signature,
call it `r-sig`,
then the grammar is ambiguous.

Proof:
Since all the symbols `r-sig`
in `r-sig` are productive, it
derives a sentence,
call it `unseen`.
The sentence `seen . unseen` is derived
from derivation trees containing both eruptions.
Since the two eruptions are distinct,
they occur in distinct derivation trees.
By the definition of ambiguous, then,
the grammar which they share is ambiguous.
QED.

## Middle recursion subsumption

The Middle Recursion Subsumption Theorem:
If `M` is a middle recursive symbol and
```
   1) M =>* pre1 A post1`
```
and
```
   2) A =>* pre2 M post2`,
```
then `A` is a middle recursive symbol.

Proof:
`M` is middle recursive so by the
definition of middle recursion
```
    3) M =>* pre3 M post4
    4) |pre3| > 0
    5) |post3| > 0
    6) M =>* pre3 pre1 A post1 post3 ; by eq. 1, 3
    7) A =>* pre2 pre3 pre1 A post1 post3 post2
         by eq. 2, 6
    8) |pre2 pre3 pre1| > 0 by eq. 4
    9) |post2 post3 post1| > 0 by eq. 5
```
From the definition of middle recursion and
eq. 7, 8 and 9, we have that `A` is a middle
recursive symbol.
QED.

## Descending an eruption

We define an *eruption sequence*
as a sequence of dotted rules,
where

* no rule occurs twice; and

* no dotted rule is a prediction.

As a reminder, there are no empty rules in `g`.

An eruption sequence
is of length at most `#rules`.
the number of rules in `g`.
Let `rhs-occurrences(sym, rule)` be the
number of times `sym` occurs in `rule`.
Let 'max-ro` be the maximum value of
`rhs-occurrences(sym, rule)` for
any `(sym, rule)` pair.
The number of eruption sequences in `g`
is at most
`(#rules)! * (max-ro * #rules)`.

We now consider a descent of the eruption,
starting from the top of the plume.
Since `g` is augmented,
this must be the RHS of the start rule,
starting at location 0 and ending at
location |w|.

In descending,
at each step of the eruption we must
choose a rule
and an expansion symbol.
Call the rule `r` and let it be `lhs ::= rhs`.
Note that `lhs` will not necessarily be
a symbol on the RHS of the rule preceding
`r`, because recursions may intervene
between two rules in the eruption plan.

We use the eruption sequence to constraint
our choices.
The first occurence of each rule at a rule choicepoint
in the descent
must follow the eruption sequence.
The choice at the dot choicepoint which preceeds
a rule choicepoint must be to place the dot
at the position of the dot in the
same rule in the eruption sequence.

We call a choicepoint trivial iff there is
only one alternative to choose from at
that choicepoint.
We call a choicepoint non-trivial iff it is
not trivial.

We now consider,
following the descent in top-to-bottom order,
the first non-trivial
choicepoint for the unfraught grammar `g`.

## Planned eruptions

Let an eruption plan be as described above.

Lemma: Let the eruption be free of
pure left recursions.
Then, for
an eruption plan,
and some `g`,
and some `w[0,erloc]`,
Then we know the height
of the eruption and,
for every step of the eruption,
its rule, expansion symbol and span.

Proof:
We look first at the sequence of dot
positions and rules,
descending the steps from
the top of the eruption to the bottom.

For `st[0]`, we know that its rule is
the start rule of `g`,
and its span is `[0, |w|]`,
where `|w|` is the length of the input.
In the case of the top of the plume,
there is no prior step,
so that expansion symbol is undefined.

Assume that we know the rule for the step,
`st[i]`.
Call the step after it `st[i+1]`.
If `st[i+1]` occurs for the first time,
which symbol in `st[i]` is expanded,
and what the rule of `st[i+1]` is,
are determined by
the eruption plan.
If `st[i+1]` has appeared before it is
either pure right or muddle recursive,
by assumption for the lemma.
We leave the case of pure right recursion
for later.
By the assumption for unfraught grammars
and muddle recursion,
`s[i]` and the characters up to the first
character in
the span of `st[i+1]`
determine `st[i+1]`.
Since the eruption location must be inside
`st[i+1]`, we do know all the characters 
as far as the first character of `st[i+1]`.

So far, then, we have shown that,
for muddle recursions, and
for single-occurence rules,
we know which symbol in `st[i]` is expanded,
and the rule of `st[i+1]`.
For pure right recursions,
after the first occurrence of a rule,
the expansion
symbol is always the rightmost.

It remains to show that the eruption 
has a fixed number of steps.
It also remains
to determine the span of all steps,
and to determine the rule for those
steps which are pure
right recursions.

The span of the eruption steps,
the number of steps in the pure right recursions,
and the rule of those steps,
does not affect the right signature of an
eruption.
So we do
know the right signature of our eruption,
and that it is unique.

Suppose, for a reductio,
that two eruptions differ either in the

* the number of steps in one of their pure right
  recursions; or

* the rule of a pure right recursive step; or

* the span of any step.

Then we have two different eruptions,
due to different factoring.
But we have shown that they have the
same signature.
By the Signed Eruption Theorem,
this means that `g` is ambiguous.
An ambiguous `g` is contrary to assumption,
which shows that reductio.

Therefore, we know

* the number of steps in the eruption;

* the expansion symbol for all steps below
  the top of the plume;

* the rule of all steps in the eruption; and

* the span in all steps of the eruption,

* and that these are unique.

In determining these
we used only the grammar `g`,
the eruption plan and `w[0,erloc]`.
