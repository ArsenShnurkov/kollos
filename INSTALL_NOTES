Because this repository is a collection of development environments
created for refactoring, there is no 100% up-to-date, accurate
installation procedure.  The contents of this file are notes,
collected to help the author figure out how to set up a brand new
clone of the repository for development.  For his own sake, if
nothing else, the author tries to keep these accurate and up-to-date.
He does not succeed 100%.

If this combined repository lasts long enough, and stabilizes, maybe
someday there will be a real installation checklist.

1.) In the xs/libmarpa/dev directory, run "make".

2.) In the xs/libmarpa/dev directory, run "make install".

3.) In the xs/libmarpa/dist directory, follow the instructions in
the README file.

4.) In the xs directory, run "perl Build.PL".  Then run "./Build
code".

5.) In the pp directory, run "perl Build.PL".  Then run "./Build
code".

6.) In the html directory, run "perl Build.PL".  Then run "./Build
code".
